##  Overview  
This project focuses on **predicting diabetes** using machine learning models.  
We worked with a public dataset and applied different algorithms to compare their performance.  

---

##  What We Did  
- ✅ Preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, scaling features).  
- ✅ Split the data into training and testing sets.  
- ✅ Built and tuned three models using **GridSearchCV**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- ✅ Evaluated models using **ROC-AUC** and compared results.  
- ✅ Visualized:  
  - Feature importances (**Random Forest**)  
  - Coefficient magnitudes (**Logistic Regression & Linear SVM**)  
- ✅ Selected the best-performing model.  
- ✅ Saved the final pipeline as **`best_diabetes_pipeline.joblib`** for future use.

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python** 
- **scikit-learn**   
- **pandas**  
- **seaborn & matplotlib**

## Goal  
To identify the most suitable machine learning model for diabetes prediction and provide a reusable pipeline.
